Magnetic drift is a game where you drive a small car around a maze with different colored walls. The car is attracted to walls which are the same color as the car, and the car can perform a "polarity switch" to change color.

Basic movement with tank controls using ~wasd~, break with ~Left Shift~. Press ~e~ to swap polarity. Ideally drifting will be possible, which will justify the name of the game.

Include basic tile-based maps, with tiles for sides and diagonals. Walls can be red, blue, or gray. Gray walls have no significant impact on the player, but red and blue walls with attract or repel the player depending on which polarity the player is. If the player is blue, they will be attracted to blue walls, and if they are red, they will be pushed by blue walls. The same is true for red, but in reverse.

Ideally there will eventually be an in-game level editor, and a way to serialize and deserialize said levels so they can be shared between games. The save files should also not be os-specific, so that should mean that linux save files will work on windows, and vice versa. This probably is an irrelevant concern, but I just want to make sure that the library used doesn't do that.

Other objects in the game: Include tires, and maybe little bombs or something, and oil slicks. Tires will just bump around and let you not collide directly with the wall. Bombs would obviously explode, and oil slicks would make you lose traction for a while (and this is a good opportunity for effects, because it could also leave streaks). Bombs should also be of different colors, so that you can repel or attract some of them depending on your color.
Bombs will damage the vehicle, which will cause it to move more slowly and sluggishly, and if the vehicle is hit multiple times then it may kill the car.

Games will be done as time-trials, where it will save the time that you've done. If I have extra time, I could also add phantom vehicles for the previous best time, and maybe even include a baseline "par" which would be me deliberately doing mediocre (because I imagine that by the end of the jam I'll be pretty good at this). Leaderboard should also include my best times for each level, but the phantom for that should be a special thing which you can enable/disable, because if it's particularly good, then it may prevent you from effectively viewing your personal best.

Camera movement will be interesting to handle. It should in theory not be required if players are playing at a decent resolution, but I need to detect to see if the screen is so small that it can't show the entire level at once, in which case it will pan around. This should also account for strange aspect ratios played at because of tiling window managers or whatever else.
